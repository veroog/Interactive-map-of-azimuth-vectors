# Interactive map of azimuth vectors
Interactive mapping of azimuth vectors from shear-wave splitting measurements

## Description

Plot shear wave splitting measurements (fast shear-wave orientations) as vectors with a time slider

## Dependencies
* Obspy
* Bokeh 

### Executing program

* You will need a single spreadsheet for all seismic stations with columns for longitude, latitudes, dates, stations, and angles
* From terminal in same directory:
```
bokeh serve --show Interactive_Map_AzimuthLines.py
```
